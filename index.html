                                    An app I helped prototype new features for during my 2018 summer internship at Greenlee. 
                                    <br>
                                    The goal was to bring a WiFi heatmapping feature from an older product into the new GigaCheck system, which would allow technicians to quickly measure and show clients where the WiFi connection is strongest in a house. The technician could do so by drawing a floorplan in the app, taking measurements with firmware, and then displaying the combined heatmap-layout render to the client. 
                                    <br>
                                    The app was written in Javascript as an AngularJS (v1) based Single Page Application. PhoneGap/Apache Cordova was used to port the app over to Android and iOS. The floorplan illustrator was implemented using Javascript to manipulate SVG elements, and the heatmap renderer relied on HTML5 canvases and SVG manipulation. Styling was done using Bootstrap.
                                    <br>
                                    The app was presented to the engineering department and potential clients, and recieved positive feedback. Documentation was written to ensure the new features were well recorded.

                                    An automatic test generator that takes in a formatted test in plaintext and generates a digital version that can be taken on a device in lieu of paper, created as part of a professor-led project course.

                                    I helped implement the parser portion of the generator by creating the front end using React UI and sending the parsed result to the backend database.

                                    A React-based secure social media site. Developed with Team Missing Tooth for a software engineering course. 
                                    <br>
                                    The codebase was forked from an existing social media site implementation. A development pipeline was implemented via Travis CI, which included automatic lint checks, unit testing, and end-to-end testing. The codebase will be inherited in other classes in later courses. All messages on the site are encrypted, and are only visible to friends.
                                    <br>
                                    My role was documentation, and I wrote documentation for each of the classes and their functionality to help the next team have an easier time understanding the codebase than our team did.
